# Cluster_Analysis_for_students_BEST2020_add_stars_above_repo
The best implementation of a neural network of cluster analysis in which nodes and clusters are set with a mouse, and 2 metrics are used, the application can be easily scaled.

# 0 step
download repo and add sources into your project

# 1 step
Ðœost likely you will have an error finding the image on the specified path.

To do this, you need to change the path to the image cluster.png, also you can delete the file itself, but this is my personal tribute to my beloved judas_priest group

MainUI.java, 49 line  image = ImageIO.read(new File("/home/gerdon/IdeaProjects/Cluster_Analysis/src/pics/cluster.png")); 

# 2 step
start using app

Add static nodes to the white canvas to the left of the menu with the left mouse button, the choice is made by switching the radio buttons

add dynamic clusters also in the white canvas area

Choose the metric that is most convenient for you, you can also write your own metric and use it on a par with those that I implemented. I will be pleased if you fork my project with the changes that you find most needed. The divine step button, there is also a link to the song of the coroner group

Repeat the iteration of the algorithm

Try to change the metric, sometimes it affects the final picture
